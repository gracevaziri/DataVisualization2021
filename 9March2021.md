This week I'm commenting on a figure from the paper *Replicated Landscape Genomics Identifies Evidence of Local Adaptation to Urbanization in Wood Frogs* in the  [Journal of Heredity](https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/110/6/707/5529283?login=true#164267378).

This paper used ddRAD-Seq to look at whether wood frogs living in urban environments undergo parallel evolution due to urban specific selection factors. The authors used wood frogs from four paired urban and non-urban replicate locations, and identified genotypes that showed evidence of directional selection across replicates. They presented the following figure to highlight 12 loci that showed evidence of directional selection based on the environment of the frog, and the genotypes indicating selection. 

My main complaint with this figure is that the same colors are used to communicate different genotypes. For example, for urban frogs, the T/T genotype of the 12782_12 locus iandthe G/G genotype of the 67705_12 locus are nearly fixed. However, they are both shown in blue. I found the scheme of facetting the boxplots showing genotype frequencies by environment, by the locus identity a bit hard to follow. I would have rather seen two graphs, one for urban, and one for rural. The y axis would remain genotype frequency. The x axis would be locus identity. The genotype would be colored so that each genotype would have a consistent color across loci. This would require me to have 9 colors, but I think it would still be managable.
