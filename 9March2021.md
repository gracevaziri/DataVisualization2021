This week I'm commenting on a figure from the paper *Replicated Landscape Genomics Identifies Evidence of Local Adaptation to Urbanization in Wood Frogs* in the  [Journal of Heredity](https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/110/6/707/5529283?login=true#164267378).

This paper used ddRAD-Seq to look at whether wood frogs living in urban environments undergo parallel evolution due to urban specific selection factors. The authors used wood frogs from four paired urban and non-urban replicate locations, and identified SNPs that showed evidence of directional selection across replicates. They presented the following figure to highlight 12 loci that showed evidence of directional selection based on the environment of the frog, and the type of SNP detected.
