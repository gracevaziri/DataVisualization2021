I am trying to learn about different ways to visualize gene expression data and saw some papers using chord plots. These plots can help show relationships between genes and the gene ontogeny terms they are associtaed with. 

This is useful beacause the results of differential gene expression analysis can be overwhelming (many genes may be up/down regulated) and the different gene names an ontogeny terms are not familiar (at least to me). 

Below is an image of a chord plot I liked from the PNAS paper 'RNA-seq reveals conservation of function among the yolk sacs of human, mouse, and chicken' by Tereza Cindrova-Davies, Eric Jauniaux, Michael G. Elliot, Sungsam Gong, Graham J. Burton, and Stephen Charnock-Jones.
